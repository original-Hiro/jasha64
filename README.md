## Introduction

In this repo are my historical code, starting from 2012 when I first learned programming.

Note: For easy maintenance, this repo only contains small programs; my large projects are splitted out into separate repos such as [jasha64/ARM9-compatible-soft-CPU-core](https://github.com/jasha64/ARM9-compatible-soft-CPU-core). Should you be interested, do check them out.

## Contents

Source code files are organized chronologically. Main contents of each period:

**2012-2013** Basic C++ programming

**2014-2017** NOI

- "NOI" stands for "National Olympiad in Informatics", a series of algorithm competitions for middle school students in China
- It's my senior high school years. I participated in NOI, won second prize in NOI 2016 Winter Camp and won bronze medal in APIO 2016 (Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad)

**Spring 2018** (2nd semester in university, "[第2学期](https://github.com/jasha64/jasha64/tree/master/第2学期)") ACM-ICPC; Object Oriented Programming

- My first semester since transferring from mathematics to computer science
- During this period I participated in ACM-ICPC, but quitted soon for many reasons
- "Object Oriented Programming" is one of my courses this semester; similarly hereinafter

**Fall 2018** (3rd semester, "[第3学期](https://github.com/jasha64/jasha64/tree/master/第3学期)") Data Structure; Digital Logic and Circuit Design

- The "Programming" folder includes some simple C programs, when I tested some system functions to fully understand them. "Programming" is one of our compulsory courses; since I had already learned C programming during middle school years, this semester I applied for exemption (not having to attend this course) and passed this course autonomously

**Spring 2019** (4th semester, "[第4学期](https://github.com/jasha64/jasha64/tree/master/第4学期)") Databases; Introduction to Computer Systems; Python Programming

**Fall 2019** (5th semester) Hardware Experiments; Computer Networks; My curriculum vitae in LaTeX; Natural Language Processing

- Also includes miscellaneous files for my first trying LaTeX, LaTeX slides template in PowerPoint, etc.
- 上过半学期计算机视觉，因老师讲课质量太差退课了
