## Hardware Experiments 硬件实验 (COMP130041.01)

It's another exciting lab of our hardware experiments course.

In this lab, we're asked to design an application with "**Leap Motion**" somatosensory controller. Imitating a demo program GameWAVE(https://gallery.leapmotion.com/gamewave/), I present MiniGameWAVE, written in Java.

**MiniGameWAVE** currently supports Diablo II and Dynasty Warriors 8 / Shin Sangokumusou 7, but it's easy to be extended to various games or other applications. It also includes a frontend designed by Java Swing.

You'll need **Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA** to open this project.



Below are my videos for playing games with MiniGameWAVE:

Diablo II
