## Hardware Experiments 硬件实验 (COMP130041.01 Lifeng Chen 陈利锋)

It's an interesting lab of our hardware experiments course.

In this repo are the source code for building up a battery stack monitor demonstration circuit with Linear Technology DC2026C microcontroller board(Linduino® One), DC2350AB 18-cell battery stack monitor and DC1941 isoSPI receiver. Main feature includes: drawing input data into a chart with C#; interacting with device registers to activate passive battery cell balancing.

**SerialPortListener** is a Visual Studio project, and **DC2350AB** is to open with Arduino. My operating system is Windows 10.
