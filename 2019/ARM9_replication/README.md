This is a project replicating the experimental results from the book *ARM9-compatible CPU soft core design based on FPGA*(《兼容ARM9的软核处理器设计：基于FPGA》).

Currently I have successfully replicated the experiments in Chapter 2-4, 7, 8, and is currently working on Chapter 9, 10.

**xpr** projects are to open with Vivado 2015.4, and **uvproj** projects are to open with μVision>=4. My operating system is Windows 10.
